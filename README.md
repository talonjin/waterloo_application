# Talon Jin's Waterloo AIF

## About You - Part A

### Question 1: Reasons for choosing your program and Waterloo (* required)

>Please tell us about your educational goals, your interest in your chosen program(s), and your resaosns for applying to the University of Waterloo. If you have applied to more than one program please discuss your interest in each program. (900 character limit).

My educational goals are to achieve academic excellence and to be able to apply my learnings in the real world to positively impact others. I’ve been visiting UW since my brother was accepted in 2013. Seeing how he and his classmates can impact the lives of so many people with a computer is very inspiring. Applying to SE is a natural first choice as my brother is in CS and my parents are mechanical engineers. CS and CFM would follow as it also aligns with my interests and educational goals. I’m applying to UW because of the growth and culture UW provides for not only academic successes, but also for their athletes. During the varsity swim team recruiting event this year, I was given the opportunity to swim and talk to many student-athletes about their experiences. This has inspired me to not only apply to UW, but to also become a candidate for the 2018 varsity team as well.

| Employer | Job Title | Brief Description of Work | Hrs/Wk | Start Date | End Date |
| -------- | --------- | ------------------------- | ------ | ---------- | -------- |
| Vaughan Community Centre
(Christine Carlini-Griffo) | Swim Instructor | I’m a certified swim instructor and have enjoyed teaching over 40 different swimmers, from parent & tot to swimmer 6. Most of all, I enjoyed and admired teaching impaired swimmers because it provided a new challenge along with different teaching strategies. 

Providing smiles to each swimmer as well as improving their swimming capabilities and more importantly their water safety was the best part of the job.

At the end of each lesson I communicated with each swimmer’s parents about what they did well and various areas of improvement. Using my communication skills I was able to pass/fail swimmers without any complaints. | 6 | | |

I’ve always believed that being a well-rounded student stems far beyond a classroom. Thus, I always strive for new opportunities to learn and grow to become a better version of myself. Apart from school, swimming has taught me many life skills. Mainly, it has taught me to never give up and to always work hard to overcome adversity. Whether that means giving it 110% on every lap or managing my time effectively with school, I’ve learned that the work you put in reflects the results you receive. Leadership is also important, which is why I took the opportunity to work as a swim instructor, coach my school swim team and join leadership camps. Through leadership, I’ve learned that I can inspire and motivate others. I’ve also joined many athletic teams which taught me how to cooperate and work with others. This is important as teamwork is a key skill to have to be successful anywhere in life.

## Engineering

### Question 1: Engineering Interests and Goals

> Briefly explain why you are interested in engineering and particularly in the program to which you have applied. Comment, for example on your interests and abilities; your career goals; exposure to engineering through school/related and other experiences; and discussions you have had with engineers, teachers, current/past Waterloo students.

Engineering first sparked my interest in grade 9 during take your kids to work day. I was inspired by what my parents do as mechanical engineers as they were building new transformers that would eventually give power to structures that people use across the world. My interest for software engineering came from my brother who was studying CS at UW. I visited Facebook during his internship and I learned that you can impact just as many lives through software development. I soon realized that the software development field is doing a lot of interesting work such as image recognition to classify diseases and computer vision for self-driving vehicles in the autonomous field. These are examples where software can be used to save and impact a lot of lives. This showed me that software engineering has endless applications that align with my educational interests and career goals.

### Question 2: More About Your Goals

> What sort of things would you like to do or accomplish in Waterloo Engineering and why?

Within UW Engineering, I definitely want to graduate with honors and excellent standing, but most of all, I aspire to represent UW Engineering as a swimmer on the varsity swim team and make engineering proud. In addition, I would like to expand my knowledge outside of academics and be a part of engineering teams working on challenging problems such as solar powered cars (Midnight Sun) or building Hyperloop pods (Waterloop). These are amazing opportunities made possible by the Sedra Student Design Center in E5, and it provides a way for me to meet like-minded students who want to work on something impactful and beneficial for humanity. Lastly, I would like to join Velocity to broaden my knowledge and learn from students with backgrounds in business and entrepreneurship. This would help me dive deeper in software development and properly apply it to improve the lives of others.

### Question 3: Programming Knowledge

> If you have applied to Software Engineering you are required to demonstrate that you have experience in developing well-structured, modular programs. However all applicants should list their programming experience if applicable.
> 
>  For every programming language in which you have atleast four months of programming experience, list the language, number of months experience you have in using the langague (not how long you have known it), and capacity in which you use the language (e.g., courses completed, work experience, self education).
