## About You - Part A

### Question 1: Reasons for choosing your program and Waterloo (* required)

>Please tell us about your educational goals, your interest in your chosen program(s), and your resaosns for applying to the University of Waterloo. If you have applied to more than one program please discuss your interest in each program. (900 character limit).

My educational goals are not only to maintain academic excellence (high averages), but to also take what I have learned throughout my years and apply my knowledge to the real world and impact others. Growing up, technology has always sparked my interest and I became increasingly curious to learn more about it as it has drastically impacted human lives including myself. Since my brother is in computer science at the University of Waterloo and both my parents are mechanical engineers, software engineering seemed inevitable as my first interest in my chosen programs. Computer science and computer and financial management would follow along because it aligns with my interests in technology and ability to impact the lives of others in a positive manner. I applied to the University of Waterloo because I believe it will provide me great opportunities to fulfill my goals.
