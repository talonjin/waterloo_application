## About You - Part A

### Question 1: Reasons for choosing your program and Waterloo (* required)

>Please tell us about your educational goals, your interest in your chosen program(s), and your resaosns for applying to the University of Waterloo. If you have applied to more than one program please discuss your interest in each program. (900 character limit).

My educational goals are to achieve academic excellence throughout university and be able to apply my learnings in the real world to positively impact others. I’ve been visiting UW since my brother was accepted in 2013. Seeing his growth throughout the years has been very inspirational. Being a competitive swimmer, I was able to join many varsity swim practices at UW and enjoyed the growth and culture they had provided. This has inspired me to not only apply to UW, but to also become a candidate for the 2018 varsity team as well. I’ve also gotten to know a lot of my brother’s classmates and it fascinates me how they can impact the lives of so many people with just a computer. Applying to SE is a natural first choice as my brother is in CS and my parents are mechanical engineers. CS and CFM would follow as it also aligns with my interests in technology and ability to have great impact.

I coached my school swim team and qualified for OFSAA with four other teammates. I also came first in the 100m Butterfly at YRAA’s and AA.

I’ve always believed that being a well-rounded student stems far beyond a classroom. Thus, I always strive for new opportunities to learn and grow to become a better version of myself. Apart from school, swimming has taught me many life skills. Mainly, it has taught me to never give up and to always work hard to overcome adversity. Whether that means giving it 110% on every lap or managing my time effectively with school, I’ve learned that the work you put in reflects the results you receive. Leadership is also important, which is why I took the opportunity to work as a swim instructor, coach my school swim team and join leadership camps. Through leadership, I’ve learned that I can inspire and motivate others. I’ve also joined many athletic teams which taught me how to cooperate and work with others. This is important as teamwork is a key skill to have to be successful anywhere in life.
